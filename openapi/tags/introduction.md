This specification is intended to to be a good starting point for describing
your API in [OpenAPI/Swagger format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).

It also demonstrates features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo) tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) documentation engine. So beyond the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).
